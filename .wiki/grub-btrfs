1. clone grub-btrfs and run "make install"
2. edit /etc/default/grub-btrfs using custom file in .dotfiles
   (uncomment all rows with /boot/grub2)

The intention is that you don't need to change the file /etc/grub.d/41_snapshots-btrfs since that is overwritten when an update is installed..
Instead you change the values in /etc/default/grub-btrfs/config. The ${GRUB_BTRFS_GRUB_DIRNAME:-"/boot/grub"} means: Use the value in GRUB_BTRFS_GRUB_DIRNAME unless it's not defined, in this case then use /boot/grub
The reason is that 41_snapshots-btrfs can get overwritten with an update, and you would loose your changes where /etc/default/grub-btrfs is usually protected by some mechanism like Gentoos dispatch-conf for example.

To tell Fedora users they have to configure some things it says

# Location of the folder containing the "grub.cfg" file.
# # Use by grub-btrfs to save the file "grub-btrfs.cfg".
# # Might be grub2 on some systems.
# # For example, on Fedora with EFI : "/boot/efi/EFI/fedora"
# # Default: "/boot/grub"
# #GRUB_BTRFS_GRUB_DIRNAME="/boot/grub2"

in /etc/default/grub-btrfs. Maybe it would be better to have another hint for that in the readme. I am not a Fedora user, but if you make a few lines what needs to be changed for them, I would add them. But in this case, please try to use /etc/default/grub-btrfs whereever possible.
